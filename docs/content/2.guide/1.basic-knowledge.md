## How Do Relno work?

Relno will read the commit message of pull request from the git log, and then generate a release note based on the configuration file. It **rely on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)**, so you should follow the specification to write your commit message, or it will not work.

We will allow you to set how to parse the commit message in the future, but now we only support [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
