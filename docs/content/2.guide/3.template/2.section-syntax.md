# Section Syntax

You can use section tag to define a section in your template file.

Begin Syntax: `<!-- BEGIN section SECTION -->`

End Syntax: `<!-- END section SECTION -->`

Examples:

::code-group
```markdown [Template]
<!-- BEGIN test SECTION -->
This is a test section.
<!-- END test SECTION -->
```
::

If you have the same template content in multiple sections, you can define it with the following syntax:

::code-group
```markdown [Template]
<!-- BEGIN feat, refactor, test SECTION -->
The content in this section will be generated in feat, refactor and test sections.
<!-- END feat, refactor, test SECTION -->
```
::

It is very useful when you have a lot of sections with the same content.

::alert{type="warning"}
The begin tags and end tags must be identical.
::

Available sections:

- `default`
  - `PR type` (change to your defined PR type identifier)
    - `commits`

::alert{type="warning"}
`default` section is not a real section, it is the default context of the template file. In generate process, Relno will insert `default` section end tag at the end of the template file. As a result, you should never use `default` as a section name.
